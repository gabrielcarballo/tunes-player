# Tunes Player Project

Tunes Player is a music player application built using React. It allows users to search for various bands and artists, play song previews, create a list of favorite songs, and edit their profile. The application interacts with an API to fetch data and provides a seamless music listening experience.

## Project Overview

The primary goals of Tunes Player include:

- User login
- Search for a band or artist
- List available albums of a band or artist
- View songs from a selected album
- Play a preview of the songs from the album
- Add and remove songs from favorites
- View the list of favorite songs
- View the logged-in user's profile
- Edit the logged-in user's profile

## Development

The project is structured around several React components, each serving a specific purpose:

- **Login:** Renders the login form.
- **Search:** Renders the search form and the list of albums.
- **Album:** Renders the list of songs in a selected album.
- **Favorites:** Renders the list of favorite songs.
- **Profile:** Renders the user's profile.
- **ProfileEdit:** Renders the form to edit the user's profile.

The application utilizes React Router for route management, with the BrowserRouter component mapping URL paths to corresponding components. Routes are created using the Route component, and navigation links are implemented with the Link component.
